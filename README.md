# Intelligent Control Techniques for Robot Manipulators.
**An analysis of different intelligent control techniques (evolutionary alg., reinf. learn., neural networks) applied to robot manipulator.**

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is a project that a colleague of mine and I have done at Sapienza University of Rome for the **Robotics 2** class of **prof. De Luca**. 

All code by **Norman Di Palo** and **Tiziano Guadagnino**.

We explore the performance of different AI/Machine Learning techniques applied to trajectory tracking for a 3R robotic manipulator, whose dynamical model is unknown. Thus, the robot needs to learn of to precisely follow a trajectory to decrease the position and velocity error.
Our baseline is a classic PD controller.

You can find the first Notebook about **Evolutionary Algorithms** applied to neural network controllers.
In the near future I will upload other files showing the analysis of different techniques.
